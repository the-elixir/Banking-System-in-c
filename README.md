## Introduction

Modern banking systems demand security and user-friendliness. This C Banking System code showcases a menu-driven interface that enables users to register, log in, and perform various banking operations. The code promotes secure password input and user data management, providing a solid foundation for further development.

## Code Components

The code consists of several key components:
- `struct User`: Defines the user's account details, including phone number, account number, password, and balance.
- `main()`: Orchestrates the entire banking system by handling user interactions, registration, login, and banking operations.
- Menu-driven interaction: Users can choose from options such as registration, login, checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and transferring money.

## User Registration

- Users can register an account by providing their account number, phone number, and a secure password.
- Password input is masked to enhance security, ensuring sensitive data is not revealed during input.
- Registered user details are stored in an array for future reference.

## User Login

- Users can log into their accounts using their registered phone number and password.
- Password input is securely masked to prevent password exposure during login.
- The program compares the user's input with stored account details to authenticate access.

## Banking Operations

- The program offers a range of banking operations, including checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and transferring money to other registered users.
- The system validates available balance before processing withdrawal and transfer requests.
- User-friendly prompts guide users through each operation.

## Implementation Details

- The code is structured with clear loop mechanisms for menu options and user interactions.
- Password input is handled with consideration for backspace support, maintaining a smooth user experience.
- User data is managed using an array of `struct User` instances, facilitating easy access and modification.

## Limitations and Considerations

- This code is intended for educational purposes and local environment testing. It is not suitable for production use.
- Advanced security measures, such as data encryption, are not implemented in this version.
- System-specific functions used may impact portability across different platforms.

## Conclusion

The Secure Banking System in C offers a simplified yet comprehensive demonstration of user registration, login, and basic banking operations. The code encourages secure user interactions and emphasizes user-friendliness, providing a foundation for building more sophisticated and secure banking systems.
